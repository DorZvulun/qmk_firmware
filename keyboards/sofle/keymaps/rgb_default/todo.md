# Important
Forgot to backup / push the _APPS layer. can it be recreated from the controller?

# configure - cmd+k-cmd+j fold all functions in vscode, cmdk+cmd0 collaps
 
# next level ideas

* space to use as meh or lower/raise double tap to use as layers +2/-2
can use left cmd as double tap for something, toggle layer for controls
double tap on raise/lower will go to new layer, keys are meh(kc) shortcuts
or cmdx2 will be osm(meh)

* check if ctrl+esc can do ctrl+~

* add tab controls for chrome cmd+opt+arrow to switch left and right

### Notes
right arrow stack 23, 24, 21, 31
left arrow stack
